The current CozyGenDynamicInput node has these options in its javascript already, please review that node and the front end completly to understand how the options currently work with the back end and front end.

I want to break out its functionality into these, without removing the original DynamicInput. This is to remove the complex re-rendering of node in ComfyUI.

All nodes must have:
	- Default Value
	- Priority Number (Used by the front end to organize controls)

CozyGen Int Input
	- Min (Minimum allowed number to be used)
	- Max (Maximum allowed number to be used)
	- Increment (How much the front end controls increase or decrease by)
	- Randomize toggle (Wether the front end should display a randomize toggle)
CozyGen Float Input
	- Min (Minimum allowed number to be used)
	- Max (Maximum allowed number to be used)
	- Increment (How much the front end controls increase or decrease by)
	- Randomize toggle (Wether the front end should display a randomize toggle)
CozyGen String Input
	- Multiline toggle (Wether the front end should display the string control as multiline)
CozyGen Choice Input
	- Bypass toggle (Wether the front end should display a toggle to bypass the node)
